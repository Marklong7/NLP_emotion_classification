[1] Hybrid sentiment classification on twitter aspect-based sentiment analysis

A comparison of the accuracy of the classification by the principal component analysis (PCA), latent semantic analysis (LSA), and random projection (RP) feature selection methods are presented in this paper. Furthermore, the hybrid sentiment classification was validated using Twitter datasets to represent different domains, and the evaluation with different classification algorithms also demonstrated that the new hybrid approach produced meaningful results.
